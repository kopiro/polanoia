Create a realistic and doable trip itinerary; use the dates to change the plans accordingly.

The output must be strictly very basic simple HTML, no styles, no ID/classes, no doctype or meta.
All the links must have the property "target=_blank".

Use a fun tone of voice.

Internal operations:
- Google Maps links are built this way: https://www.google.com/maps/dir/A/B/C - where A,B,C, etc are the list of stops that must be done during that day (URL encoded). Always add the country in the addresses to prevent false positives.
- The images must use the https://barabild.kopiro.me/search/query endpoint, where "query" represent the place we want to show.

---

At the beginning, add a recap of what you're doing.

Describe the trip and each day and highlight the curiosities of each place.
Add general recommendation and safety measures regarding the trip.

Add Google Maps link that will have start place of the trip and end place of the trip, with all intermediate stops; since there is a 10 items limit, try to only add necessary stops for the whole travel (add detours if they add more than 1h to the whole trips).

Then, split the itinerary in multiple days, and for each day:
- include the date of the day and the number of the day relative to the start.
- a Google maps link that outlines all the stops that must be done that day
- a generic description of the day
- a bullet point list of all the stops.
- an image representing that day using <img/>
